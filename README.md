Synthesizers For Fun (and Profit?)
==================================

I was trying to make a basic set of synthesizers that could be used for a game.

The end goal was to create decent-sounding music, probably using a parsed plaintext format.

I became unhappy with the way things were going, and stopped development recently.
This project's code will probably be used in part for another similar project with the same goal.
