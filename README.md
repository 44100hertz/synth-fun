Synthesizers For Fun (and Profit?)
==================================

I was trying to make a basic set of synthesizers that could be used for a game.

The end goal was to create decent-sounding music, probably using a parsed plaintext format.

I became unhappy with the way things were going, and stopped development recently.
This project's code will probably be used in part for another similar project with the same goal.

Reasons for unhappiness:
 - I was trying to make something that can make too wide a variety of music
 - I made things too complex before making them simple
 - I designed things with unpredictable computing complexity
