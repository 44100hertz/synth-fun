* Playback
 - Sample rate and bit depth specified
 - no resampler! Anything that needs resampling uses a filter.
 - raw PCM file out for now...SDL output later
* FM Synth
** Wave I/O
 - waves.c has waveform generation functions.
 - waveforms start at 0 and end at 2*pi
 - the data waves return goes from 0 to 2pi, and needs to be quantized to be outputted
 - arbitrary number of operators, input/output goes where it does
** Envelope
 - The envelope is used to modify the volume of a carrier in order to get a different wave from the modulator
* PWM
 - PWM is achieved by linking the wavetable synth with an FM synth
* Filters / Subtractive Synth
 - Up to buffer length
 - Used as cheap resampler
* Instruments
 - Pseudo instruments from old consoles are grabbed to be used, defined accordingly
* Musical properties
** Sequencing
 - BPM is defined
** Envelope
 - Envelopes can be applied to anything
*** A few types:
 - ASDR
 - LFO
 - Defined otherwise
** Notes
 - Notes are on-tune 440hz, can use rational scales or logarithmic
* Songs
** Song "coding"
 - Made in a completely text-based format
 - Parts of songs can be coded
** Bultins
 - Key signatures, various common music things
 - Arpeggio commands

* Version Goals
** v0.1
 - Able to get any correct FM synth output in general

** v0.2
 - Basic FM synth with envelopes
 - Full GBC and NES synths

** v1.0
 - Able to write complete songs
 - Able to play back audio
